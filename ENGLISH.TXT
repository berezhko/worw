                        WORW (War Of Robot Worms)
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                             (User's Manual)

1. Description:

  Two robot worms fight in an arena among walls and treasures.
  Their aim is to collect the treasures and survive the other worm.
  A worm dies if it crashes to a wall, to the other worm's body or
  to himself.
  The worms are controlled by programs written by the players. The
  programs have to be written in Robot Worm Language, they must be in
  a file with .rwl extension, and you can send them to the Arena
  as parameters to worw.exe.

  End of game: if a worm dies (then the other one wins), or if there
  aren't any more treasure in the Arena, or through 1.000 step neither worm
  picks up any treasure (the worm who has more treasure at this time,
  wins).


2. Robot Worm Language.

  This is a language similar to BASIC in level and style, mixed with a
  few LOGO. There aren't any declaration, all variables are declarated
  automatically, you can use them anywhere.

2.1. Variables:

  These are the variables you can use:

           10 of real type:    R0,R1,...,R9
           10 of integer type: I0,I1,...,I9
           10 of boolean type: B0,B1,...,B9

  The program lines look like ones in Pascal or BASIC, except that
  you needn't put neither any numbers at the beginning of the lines
  nor semicolon at the end of each line.
  But each line contains only one command and the length of the lines
  is less or equal to 255 characters.
  Now, let's have a look at the command's syntax:

2.2. Commands:

   value assignment:    LET R1:=[expression]

   loops:
     {counter}          FOR I0:=[expression1] TO [expression2]
                          ...
                        ENDFOR

     {testing in front} WHILE ([logical expression])
                          ...
                        ENDWHILE

     {neverend}         LOOP
                          ...
                        ENDLOOP

   branch:              IF ([logical expression])
                          ...
                        ENDIF

                      or

                        IF ([logical expression])
                          ...
                        ELSE
                          ...
                        ENDIF

   remark:              REM notes

   control:             LEFT
                        {the worm turns left}

                        RIGHT
                        {the worm turns right}

   give control:        STEP
                        {Give the execution control to the enemy's program.}

   sending message:     MESS (text)
                        {writes the text to the screen. The length of text
                        must be less than 70 characters}


  Among the loops you could find a neverending loop (LOOP).
  If you write an RWL program, write it _always_ inside a neverending loop,
  otherwise after your program terminated, your worm will - without control
  - run to hell.

2.3. Operators

  arithmetic:  +,-,*,/,div,mod
  logical:     and,or,xor,not

2.4. Functions:

                    RND(x): Returns a random number that is >=0
                            and <x.

                    SIN(x),
                    COS(x): as usual; x is in rads.

                    SQR(x): square of x
                    SQRT(x):square root of x

2.4.1. Special functions:
                    LOOKAT (direction, howmany):what
                    {Returns a code specifying what does he see in 'direction'
                     at 'howmany' distance.
                    direction:0-forward, 1-to the right, 2-to the left, 3-back
                    (or:FW-forward, RT-right, LT-left, BK-back (constant))
                    howmany: how many cells from the head.
                    what:0-nothing, 1-treasure, 2-himself, 3-wall, 4-enemy}

                    LOOK(x,y):what
                    {x,y are two numbers in the range -5..5, they specify
                    a cell in a coordinate system (where the centre is the
                    worm's head, and is relative to the worm's direction),
                    where the worm looks to.
                    So: (0,0) is the worm's head.
                    (0,1) is the same as LOOKAT(FW,1), (-3,0) is the same as
                    LOOKAT(LT,3), (5,0) is the same as LOOKAT(RT,5).
                    Returns the object's code, what could he see there:
                    what:0-nothing, 1-treasure, 2-himself, 3-wall, 4-enemy}

                    FEEL:direction
                    {Returns the direction's code where he feels the nearest
                    wall or enemy in an 5 cell range. If there are more,
                    returns the nearest one.
                    direction:0-forward, 1-at right, 2-at left, 3-back
                    (vagy:FW-forward, RT-right, LT-left, BK-back, NT-nowhere)}

                    LENGTH:number
                    {Returns the length of worm}

                    DIRECTION:number
                    {Returns the worm's direction}

                    GETX:number
                    {Returns the worm's head's X coordinate
                     in the Arena.}

                    GETY:number
                    {Returns the worm's head's Y coordinate
                     in the Arena.}


2.5. Relational operators:

  In logical expressions you can use these relational operators as usual:
                    =,>,<,<>,<=,>=


2.6. Example:

  Now there is a very simple example RWL program:

    REM 1st exam. Name: TURN LEFT!
    REM
    REM neverending cycle
    LOOP
      REM if 3 cells ahead he sees a wall, enemy or his body...
      IF (LOOKAT(FW,3)>=2)
        REM then turn left.
        LEFT
      ENDIF
    ENDLOOP


3. Control-sharing between the two worms' programs:

  The execution of the programs alternates between the two programs,
  but not after every line. After three "important" line switches to
  the other program.
  "Important" lines are e.g.: IF, LET... "Not important" are ENDIF,
  ENDWHILE, REM....
  So: The Arena executes three "important" lines from the 1st program,
  then executes three "important" lines from the 2nd program, then both
  worms step one.
  This "three-domination" is broken only by LEFT, RIGHT and STEP. After such
  a line immediately comes the other program's turn.

  "Important" commands, that increase the program's stepnumber:

LET, FOR, IF, ENDLOOP, WHILE, LEFT, RIGHT, STEP.

  "Not important" commands, that don't increase the program's stepnumber:

REM, ENDFOR, ELSE, ENDIF, LOOP, ENDWHILE.


4. Using Arena (worw.exe):

  You have to specify the two RWL programs (that want to play) as parameters.
  It is done like that (in the simplest case):

C:\WORW> worw first.rwl second.rwl

  Then some information comes to the screen about which worm fights in what
  color. Please press any key to continue.
  1., If any program have a syntax error, then you can read the
      error message and the error's location.
  2., If everything is OK, then the fight starts in the Arena.

4.1. Run-time commands (keys):

  The fight's speed can be modified with F2 through F10. With F1 you
  can switch off/on the voice.
  With the Esc key you can stop the fight.


5. ini_file:

  You can create a worw.ini file and set your own speed and voice.
  In this file, these sections are available:

  [SPEED]
  number

  The number is in the range 1..9, this determines the speed setting.
  (1-fastest, 9-slowest)

  [VOICE]
  word

  The word is YES or NO depending on whether you want sound effects or not.
  (YES: sound is on, NO: sound is off)

  [MIXING]
  number

  This number can go from 8000 to 30000 and determines the mixing frequency.
  This is only particular if you want to run 'worw' on a machine slower than
  386DX-40 Mhz. In this case, you can speed up the fight with a number less
  than the default value 22050 (e.g. 11025), but the sound quality will be
  poorer - a high frequency beep can be heard.

  Example for worw.ini:
[VOICE]
YES
[SPEED]
3
[MIXING]
22050


6. Campaign:

  It is a bit complicated to compare two programs, because in only one fight
  one can't see which program is better (the random events....etc). We
  suggest that you would make more fights between them and from the results
  you can see which is the better one (or the best).

  For more fights (campaign) use the "-c" switch. After the -c switch
  put a number which specifies how many fights will be processed.
  E.g.: worw first.rwl second.rwl -c 21
  for 21 fights.

  After the fights, worw writes the result to the screen. Between
  two fight it does not wait for 'press any key'.
  For winning or egal the worm gets 1 point, for defeat it gets 0 point.


7. Other switches:

  You can use other ini file (not the worw.ini) with "-i".
    -i <file>

  The Arena writes to the log all the fight's result. Default log is
  'worw.log', this file contains the RWL's name, the turns' results and
  the final result (in campaign mode). You may use another log file with "-l".
    -l <file>

  In campaign mode, if you aren't interested in visual actions, you can
  turn off the graphics with "-q". Then you will see only the actual
  result and you will hear no sound.
    -q

  With the "-k" switch you can avoid the waiting for press a key at the
  beginning and in the end. In campaign mode this is the default.
    -k

  If you have a slow PC and don't want to write (or modify) a worw.ini, you
  can pop down the voice's quality with "-s".
    -s
